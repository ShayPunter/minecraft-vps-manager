## About Minecraft VPS Manager

Minecraft VPS Manager is a web application which seamlessly enables friends and players to boot up a particular server and play on it. It uses Linode as the hosting provider and has a server watchdog which will shut down the server after 15 minutes of player inactivity, saving you money.

-   Web interface which users can interact with and boot new servers up
-   Seamless integration with Linode (more providers to come)
-   Server watchdog which will shutdown the server safely if no player has logged in within 15 minutes.

## Setting up the Minecraft VPS Manager

## Improvements to Minecraft VPS Manager

-   The creation of an admin panel which will enable you to:
    -- Create new servers (names, which Linode instance it should use, a storage volume to attach to (S3 support coming soon))
    -- Lock servers behind an admin panel, which will require user accounts to be created in order to start up servers
-   Optimisation to server loading and status reporting (in progress)
-   Better route management and naming
